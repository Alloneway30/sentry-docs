# Span Propertires

Instead of spans containing tags, context, and data, we'll unify all these properties into a new “attributes” property.
Similar to OTel's semantic conventions, we'll add special meaning to certain attribute keys, such as `sentry.release`, `sentry.op`, etc.

```js
span.setAttribute('http.request.method', 'GET')
span.setAttribute('user.email', 'jane.doe@example.com')
```

We'll map these attributes to their respective existing property in Relay to ease the work required for the product during the transition period.
