title: Span Sampling & Filtering
---

Any APIs exposed to the user to sample or filter spans must adhere to the following design principles:

- The APIs are optimized for trace completness
- The APIs are optimized for conclusive sampling decisions

## Sample root spans with `tracesSampleRate` & `tracesSampler`



## Filter spans with `ignoreSpans` & integration config



## Sanitize span attributes with `beforeSendSpans`
