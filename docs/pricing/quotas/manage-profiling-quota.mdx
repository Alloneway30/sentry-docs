Sentry's [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/) feature provides precise, code-level visibility into application execution in a production environment. Profiling lets you see your call stack in detail without you needing to add any custom instrumentation. With Profiling, you can quickly identify hot paths in your code and understand potential performance bottlenecks.

Sentry offers [two profiling modes](/product/explore/profiling/transaction-vs-continuous-profiling/): transaction-based and continuous, which have different billing implications. For continuous profiling, cost is determined by the length of the profile in milliseconds and is billed in hours.



<Note>

The PAYG budget is only available on **paid plans**.

## Managing Usage



## Key Terms

- **Reserved Quota**: The number of cron monitors included in your plan.
- **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Budget**: A budget you set to pay for additional monitors beyond your reserved quota.
- **Reusable Quota**: Quota freed up by deactivating or deleting monitors within the same billing period, which can be reused for new or reactivated monitors at no additional cost.

## Viewing and Adjusting Your PAYG Budget

To check or adjust your monthly PAYG budget for profiling:

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Subscription**.
2. Review your current PAYG budget.
3. Adjust your budget as needed.

**Activation Process:**

1. **Check for Reusable Quota**

   - Sentry first checks if there's any **reusable quota** from monitors deactivated or deleted within the **same billing period**.
   - If available, the monitor is activated using this quota **at no additional cost**.

2. **Use PAYG Budget or Reserved Quota**

   - If no reusable quota is available, Sentry uses your **reserved quota** or **PAYG budget** to activate the monitor.
   - The cost is deducted from your PAYG budget.

<Alert>

**Important:** Quota reuse only applies **within the same billing period** and to monitors that were previously assigned and billed.

</Alert>

### Activation Across Billing Periods

At the start of each new billing period:

- **Quota Reset**: All quotas reset, and any reusable quota from the previous period is no longer available.
- **Re-evaluation of Monitors**:

  - If you have sufficient **reserved quota** or **PAYG budget**, monitors that were previously active will remain active.
  - If there isn't enough budget, monitors may be automatically deactivated.
- **Manual Deactivations or Deletions**: Monitors that were manually deactivated or deleted will remain in that state.

## Deactivating or Deleting Monitors

You can manually deactivate or delete monitors at any time from the **Crons** page.

**Effects of Deactivation or Deletion:**

- **Quota Becomes Reusable**: The quota from the deactivated or deleted monitor becomes available for reuse **within the same billing period**.
- **Billing Impact**: Deactivated or deleted monitors will **count** towards your billing quota if they were previously active in the current billing period. Otherwise, they don't count towards your billing quota.

<Note>

- **Quota Reuse Limitations**:

  - Reusable quota is only available **within the same billing period**.
  - Applies only to monitors that were previously active and billed.
  - **Reusable quota does not carry over to new billing periods.**

</Note>

## Tips for Managing Your Profiles

- **Monitor Your Usage**: Regularly check your active monitors and PAYG budget to avoid unexpected deactivations.
- **Adjust Budget as Needed**: If you plan to add more monitors, consider increasing your PAYG budget beforehand.
- **Plan for Renewal**: Remember that quotas reset each billing period. Ensure you have sufficient budget to keep monitors active.

By understanding how monitor activation and billing work, you can effectively manage your cron monitors and avoid interruptions in your monitoring.
