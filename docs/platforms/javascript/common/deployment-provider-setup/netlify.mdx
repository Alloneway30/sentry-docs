<Alert level="warning">
  Deploying on Netlify is still experimental. Currently, not all Sentry features are supported on the server-side. Only your frontend will be monitored.
</Alert>

<Alert level="info">
  Before approaching the steps below, read the general documentation around <PlatformLink to="/deployment-provider-setup/general/">setting up Sentry on a deployment provider</PlatformLink> to get quick general overview of the process.
  This page only shows Netlify-specific steps.
</Alert>

## Approach 1: Adding the `--import` flag

<PlatformSection supported={['javascript.nuxt']}>
  The server-side of Nuxt is deployed as a Netlify Function. So make sure to scope the environment variable `NODE_OPTIONS` to "Functions".
  The path to the function is depending on your setup. When building the preset locally, the file is available at: `.netlify/functions-internal/server/sentry.server.config.mjs`.

  <Alert level="warning">
    The docs for this are still vague and we will update them as soon as we know more about which exact path to use for the `--import` flag.

## Approach 2: Enable `experimental_basicServerTracing`


Enabling `experimental_basicServerTracing` can be used when adding the node option `--import` does not work. This however only comes with limited tracing functionality because Sentry server config is not **pre**loaded with `--import`.

<PlatformSection supported={['javascript.nuxt']}>
  Enabling this option will automatically import the Sentry server config at the top of the server entry file (server entry: `.netlify/functions-internal/server/server.mjs`).

  ```javascript {tabTitle: Nuxt Config} {filename: nuxt.config.ts}
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      sentry: {
        // ... other options
        experimental_basicServerTracing: true
      },
    })
  ```
</PlatformSection>
