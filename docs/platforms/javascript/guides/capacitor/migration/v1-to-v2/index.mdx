Version 1 of the Sentry Capacitor SDK primarily introduces API cleanup and version support changes.

This update contains behavioral changes that will not be caught by type checkers, linters, or tests, so we recommend carefully reading through the entire migration guide instead of relying on automatic tooling.

Version 9 of the SDK is compatible with Sentry self-hosted versions 24.4.2 or higher (unchanged from v8). Lower versions may continue to work, but may not support all features.

### TypeScript Version Policy

In preparation for v2 of the OpenTelemetry SDK, the minimum required TypeScript version is increased to version `5.0.4`.


## How to upgrade to SDK version 2:

When upgrading to SDK version 2, please note the main breaking changes with Sentry JavaScript SDK. More detailed information about breaking changes in the sibling SDKs can be found in the [Sibling Migration guide](#sibling-migration-guide)

- Capacitor V2 requires Sentry JavaScript SDK on version 9.x. We recommend reading below migration guide docs to find out how to address any breaking changes when upgrading the sibling dependencies to version 9.

## Sibling migration guide

Each Sibling SDK has specific changes in version 9. Follow the tutorials below to update your SDK.
