## Migrating from `sentry_flutter` `8.x` to `sentry_flutter` `9.x`

### General

- The required minimium Dart and Flutter versions are now `3.5.0` and `3.24.0` respectively. 
 - This change allows us to use safer APIs and better support for features such as Session Replay or WASM compilation.
- Remove `beforeScreenshot`
  - This has been replaced by `beforeCaptureScreenshot`
- Remove manual TTID implementation
  - The automatic TTID instrumentation has proven to be accurate so a manual one is not needed anymore
- `LoadImagesListIntegration` has been renamed to `LoadNativeDebugImagesIntegration`
- Remove old user feedback API
  - The new API is `Sentry.captureFeedback`
- Remove `enableTracing`
  - Use `options.traceSampleRate` or `options.tracesSampler` instead
- Remove `options.autoAppStart` and `setAppStartEnd`
  - The [App Start Instrumentation](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/app-start-instrumentation/) will determine the end of app start and is enabled by default
- BeforeSendTransactionCallback` now has a `Hint` parameter
- Remove `dart:html` usage in favour of `package:web`
  - The SDK is now packaged with the `package:web` dependency for better interopability with web APIs
- Remove max response body APIs
  - Due to PII, response bodies will not be added to Sentry events
  - Responses are attached to the `Hint` object, which can be read in `beforeSend`/`beforeSendTransaction` callbacks via `hint.response` so you can manually attach the response to your event.
  - In the versin `9.0.0` only the `dio` integration is supported.
- Screenshots are now by default masked
  - For example text fields are masked by default to prevent sensitive information from being leaked.
- Default log level is now `warning` when `debug = true`
  - This can be adjusted by `options.diagnosticLevel = SentryLevel.info`

### Flutter Desktop

Native crash handling is now enabled by default for Flutter Desktop. Windows ARM64 uses [breakpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad) and all other desktop platforms use [crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad).
You can turn off this feature by setting the `SENTRY_NATIVE_BACKEND` environment variable to an empty string.

### Flutter Web

The interop with the [Sentry Browser Javascript SDK](/platforms/javascript/) is now enabled by default.
During `SentryFlutter.init` the SDK will inject the CDN script into the HTML's head.
This change allows us to utilize existing SDK functionality such as native JS Errors and allows us to add new features such as release health and makes it easier to add features such as debug ids in the future.

If you initialize the native SDKs separately with `options.autoInitializeNativeSdk = false` you will also need to add the Sentry Browser Javascript SDK to your website.
[Read this guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/loader/#cdn) on how to install the Sentry Javascript SDK into your application via CDN bundles.

### Drift Integration

We have bumped the required Drift version to `2.24.0` and have changed the API on how to use the integration.
Instead of a `SentryQueryExecutor`, Sentry now provides a `SentryQueryInterceptor that you can use like so:

```
final executor = NativeDatabase.memory().interceptWith(
  SentryQueryInterceptor(databaseName: 'your_db_name')
);
```

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.18.x` to `sentry_flutter` `7.0.0`

In addition to the changes introduced in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/):

API changes:

- Sentry's Flutter SDK version 7.0.0 and above requires Flutter `3.0.0`.
- [`sentry_dio`](https://pub.dev/packages/sentry_dio), version 7.0.0 requires [`dio 5.0.0`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
- The Sentry Cocoa SDK was upgraded to `8.0.0` which introduces breaking changes, see the [migration guide](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-7x-to-8x).
- The following fields have been removed from the `SentryFlutterOptions` class and replaced:
  - `enableAutoPerformanceTracking` replaced with `enableAutoPerformanceTracing`.
  - `enableOutOfMemoryTracking` replaced with `enableWatchdogTerminationTracking`.
  - `anrTimeoutIntervalMillis` replaced with `anrTimeoutInterval`.
  - `autoSessionTrackingIntervalMillis` replaced with `autoSessionTrackingInterval`.
- The `enableNdkScopeSync` feature is now enabled by default.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.12.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.13.x`

The SDK already runs your init `callback` on an error handler, such as [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) on Flutter versions prior to `3.3`, or [`PlatformDispatcher.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html) on Flutter versions 3.3 and higher, so that errors are automatically captured. No code changes are needed on your part.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.5.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.6.x`

There are no Flutter-specific breaking changes. However, there are some in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/) for Dart.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.3.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.4.x`

To build a Flutter app for Android, Kotlin 1.5.31 or higher is required.
If your app uses a lower version, you will receive the following [error message](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/kotlin-version#summary).

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `5.1.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.0.0`

There are no Flutter specific breaking changes. However there are some in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/) for Dart.

## Migrating from `sentry_flutter` `5.0.0` to `sentry_flutter` `5.1.0`

# Android specific changes

You may remove `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` meta-data in the `AndroidManifest` file or `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` in the `gradle.properties` file if you're using the [Android Native Development Kit](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/). Sentry can now symbolicate events with the default value of [extractNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#extractNativeLibs) and [android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#behavior-changes).

A random generated installationId replaces [Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID), which has been removed. This may affect the number of unique users displayed on the the Issues page and Alerts. If you always set a custom user using Sentry.setUser(customUser), the behavior has not changed. While you don't have to make any update, if you want to maintain the old behavior, use the following code snippet.
It makes use of the [device_info_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/device_info_plus) plugin:


```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:device_info_plus/device_info_plus.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      // revert to old behavior on Android
      if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android && !kIsWeb) {
        options.addEventProcessor(addAndroidDeviceId);
      }
    },
    // Init your App.
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}

FutureOr<SentryEvent?> addAndroidId(
  SentryEvent event, {
  Hint? hint,
}) async {
  var info = await DeviceInfoPlugin().androidInfo;
  var user = (event.user ?? SentryUser()).copyWith(id: info.androidId);

  return event.copyWith(
    user: user,
  );
}
```

## Migrating from `sentry_flutter` `4.0.x` to `sentry_flutter` `5.0.0`

In addition to the changes introduced in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/):

- `SentryFlutterOptions.enableLifecycleBreadcrumbs` was replaced with `SentryFlutterOptions.enableAppLifecycleBreadcrumbs`.
- The Web Plugin Registrant import changed from `import 'package:sentry_flutter/src/sentry_flutter_web.dart';` to `import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter_web.dart';`
  - This change may lead to breaking changes. In most cases, however, this change won't lead to breaking changes since the referencing file is auto-generated.
