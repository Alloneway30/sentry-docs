The following placeholders are available in code blocks and will be replaced at build time:

- `___JS_PACKAGE___`: The current JavaScript package. (e.g. `@sentry/react`)
- `___PUBLIC_DSN___`: The public DSN for a Sentry project. (will display a dropdown of available projects if the user is logged in)

All placeholders are wrapped with **three underscores**.
