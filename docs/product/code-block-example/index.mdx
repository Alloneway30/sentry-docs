Below is a normal code block. Notice that the code block has padding.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("hello_world")

hello_world()
print("done")
```

Now, let's say I want to show a diff. Notice that there is no longer any padding on the code block (the difference is most noticeable on the unchanged lines):

```python diff
def hello_world():
-     print("hello_world")
+     print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
- print("done")
+ print("Done!")
```

Notice also that lines that stay the same are out of alignment with lines that change.

We can "fix" the incorrect alignment by indenting unchanged lines by two spaces. However, this does not fix the padding, since two spaces is more padding than the original from the normal code block:

```python diff
  def hello_world():
-     print("hello_world")
+     print("Hello, world!")

  hello_world()
- print("done")
+ print("Done!")
```

```python
def hello_world():
    print("hello_world")

hello_world()
print("done")
```

To allow for an easier comparison in the last example, I have added a normal (non-diff) block in the second tab of the above example.
