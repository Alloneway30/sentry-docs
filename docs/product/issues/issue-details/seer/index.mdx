Seer is Sentry's AI agent that powers a set of tools to help you quickly understand an issue, find a root cause, and create a fix. You can find it in the **Solutions Hub** section of the issue details page after clicking on any error from the [**Issues**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/issues/) page.

Once you've set up Seer, you'll be able to use the following features:

- [**Issue Summary**](#issue-summary): A quick summary of all the data in the issue to help you understand what's going on at-a-glance.
- [**Autofix**](#autofix): A collaborative workflow to find the root cause of an error and create a PR that fixes it.

<Alert>

Issue Summary and Autofix are currently in Beta, free of charge, for paid Sentry customers. Feedback is highly welcomed and can be submitted in-product or via email to autofix@sentry.io. Seer is not available for EU customers at this time.

## Issue Summary

The Issue Summary provides a quick overview of an issue by highlighting key insights taken from event and issue-level metadata. You'll see a quick overview of what's going wrong, a potential cause, and if relevant, insights from trace-connected issues, all in the Solutions Hub in the sidebar:

## Autofix

<Alert>

 Autofix replaces Suggested Fix (an earlier feature that has been sunset).

 </Alert>

**Autofix** uses Sentry's context (issue details, tracing data, and profiles), your codebase (integrated through GitHub), and its interactions with you to gain context, reason through the problem, and get a deeper understanding of the root cause.

When you start an Autofix run, you'll see the following screen, with an option to share any additional context:

![Autofix Start Screen](./img/autofix-start-screen.png)

Autofix will then analyze the issue and relevant code to help identify the root cause and a solution. You'll see a live stream of Autofix's thought process in real-time as it works through the problem. Autofix will share key insights as they come up and you'll have the option to expand each. You'll see the event data and code that support Autofix conclusions, building a clear chain of reasoning back to the root cause.

Since Autofix doesnâ€™t have all the context, collaboration leads to the best results. You can step in at any time to add context or feedback. If Autofix encounters gaps in its understanding, it will ask for your input.

The output will be a clearly defined root cause of the Sentry issue, and a detailed solution for how to resolve it:

You are free to edit or adjust this solution based on your own context and preferences. Once you are ready to proceed, you can select "Code It Up" to generate code resolving the bug. You have three options:

- Write a fix 
- Write a unit test reproducing the issue
- Write both

![Autofix Results](./img/autofix-results.png)

Once the coding step is complete, you can either create a Pull Request (PR) directly from Autofix, or create a branch and checkout the code locally if you would like to iterate further.

## Data Processing

We use the data listed below for analysis and to provide solutions for your review. Your data will not be used to train any models or to generate output shown to others. These features are powered by generative AI models hosted by the feature-specific subprocessors identified on our [subprocessor list](https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/). Our subprocessors will only use the data as directed by us.

The data used for these features includes:

- Error messages
- Stack traces
- Sentry spans
- DOM interactions
- Profiles
- Relevant code from linked repositories

You can learn more about our data privacy practices [here](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/security/ai-ml-policy/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).
## Disabling AI Features

If you don't find the feature useful and want to disable it for all users, you
can do so in your organization's settings with the "Hide AI Features" toggle. Also remember that the features won't be available until the proper consent is given for your organization.
