Enable screenshots by setting the `attachScreenshot` option to `true` and wrap your root widget with `SentryWidget`.

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    // Set the option to true to enable capturing screenshots
    options.attachScreenshot = true;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    // Wrap your root widget with the [SentryWidget] widget.
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Filtering Screenshots

You can filter your screenshots by using the `beforeScreenshot` callback which is called before adding a screenshot to an event.

If the callback returns `false`, the screenshot will not be attached.

By default, the callback returns `true` which means that all screenshots are attached.

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.beforeScreenshot = (event, {hint}) {
    // Example: based on some condition you can decide to attach the screenshot or drop it
    if (event.throwable is MyImportantException) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  };
});
```
