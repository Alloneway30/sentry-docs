```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    // Set the option to true to enable capturing screenshots
    options.attachScreenshot = true;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    // Wrap your app widget with the [SentryWidget] widget.
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Filtering Screenshots

You can filter your screenshots by using the `beforeScreenshot` callback.
It is called before taking a screenshot and if the callback returns `false`, the screenshot will not be attached.

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.beforeScreenshot = (event, {hint}) {
    // Return false if you don't want to attach the screenshot based on some condition.
    return true;
  };
});
```
