To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 4.0.0 of the Flutter SDK.

### Session Timeout

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than `30 seconds`. You can change the default timeout with the option `autoSessionTrackingInterval` to a Duration of your choosing.

```dart
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  // Change timeout duration until session is terminated in background
  options.autoSessionTrackingInterval = const Duration(seconds: 60)
}, appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()));
```

### Disable Auto Session Tracking

If you'd like to opt out of capturing sessions, set the option `enableAutoSessionTracking` to `false`.

```dart
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  // Disable auto session tracking
  options.enableAutoSessionTracking = false;
}, appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()));
```
