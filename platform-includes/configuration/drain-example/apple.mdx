The Apple SDK automatically stores the Sentry events on the device's disk before shutdown.

```swift
SentrySDK.close()
```

Calling `close()` before exiting the application is critical to avoid data loss.

After closing, the client cannot be used anymore. It's important to only call
`close()` immediately before shutting down the application.
