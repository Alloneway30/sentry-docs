To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
    id("io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.gradle") version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.gradle.kmp', '0.9.0') }}
    // .. your other plugins
}
```

If you support all the targets then the plugin will auto install the KMP dependency.
Otherwise you will have to manually install the KMP dependency.

## Installing Sentry Cocoa dependency

In order for the SDK to properly work for Apple targets, it is required to install the Sentry Cocoa SDK.
The important step is that in order to use the Sentry Cocoa SDK within KMP we need to configure the linker to point to the framework.
so that during compilation it knows how to resolve the symbols.

### Cocoapods

If you use the Cocoapods Gradle plugin the plugin will try to install the Sentry Cocoa SDK through the Cocoapods plugin. If there is an existing one, it will ignore it. The Cocoapods Gradle Plugin automatically sets up linking for you.

### Swift Package Manager

If you use Swift Package Manager (SPM) then the plugin will try to set up the linking for you.
Based on the project path it will determine where Xcode has cached the Sentry framework and use
that to link the framework.

If you have a custom path to the project you can use the plugin to configure that.

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
senryKmp {
  xcodeProjPath = "your_path/iOS.xcodeproj"
}
```
