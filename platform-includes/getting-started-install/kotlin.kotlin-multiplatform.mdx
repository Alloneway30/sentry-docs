To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.9.0') }}"
}
```

The plugin installs the Sentry KMP dependency. If you're using the Cocoapods plugin, it will also install the Sentry Cocoa dependency.

<Note>

If you use Swift Package Manager instead of Cocoapods, you need to install the [Sentry-Cocoa dependency via Swift Package Manager](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/install/swift-package-manager/) in your iOS project first before executing the gradle plugin. 

</Note>
